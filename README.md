# PokeMatch

Small game made to test your memory. Click on each unique pokemon and don't press on one that you've already pressed before, or else that's game over.

Project is made in React and Vite while using TailwindCSS for the styling. Helped me learn a lot of how to manage states and effects in React as well as using Vites build system to test and run the project locally.
